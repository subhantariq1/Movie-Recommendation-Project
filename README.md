# Movie Recommender Project

A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, leveraging a Kaggle movie dataset. This project demonstrates classic data science and machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on textual similarity.

## Features

- **Content-Based Recommendation:** Suggests movies similar to a given title using movie descriptions.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, removes outliers, and standardizes text data.
- **Text Mining:** Employs stemming and lemmatization to extract keywords from movie descriptions.
- **Similarity Calculation:** Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook:** All steps—exploration, modeling, and recommendations—are available in a well-organized notebook.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, nltk
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommender-Project.git
   cd Movie-Recommender-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory (adjust file paths in the notebook if necessary).

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the notebook file and follow along.

## Usage

- Run the cells sequentially in the Jupyter Notebook.
- In the final section, enter a movie title to get recommended movies based on description similarity.
- Review the similarity scores and recommended titles.

## Example

```python
# Example: Get recommendations for "The Matrix"
recommend_movies("The Matrix")
```
